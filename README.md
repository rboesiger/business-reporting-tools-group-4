### Content explanation

#### csv_to_sasdat translates the csv files into usable SAS data files


#### basetable only finds out the best and worst airlines (misleading name I know)
Spoiler : 
Worst airline : ExpressJet Airlines (EV) 
Best airline : US Airways (US)

I took into account the number of flights as well, 
EV & US have the most extreme delays while keeping a relevant size (above 20k flights in 2013)
